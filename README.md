# Calibre-Web Automated LXC

## Many Thanks

Before going any further, I have to hand it to the creators of Calibre-Web and Calibre-Web Automated, Jan B (janeczku) and crocodilestick: without their hard work, this would not be possible. Please support their work over this project, even if you use this one.

### [Calibre-Web](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web)

### [Calibre-Web Automated](https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated)

My project stands on their shoulders, and theirs in turn stands on the shoulders of the creator(s) of Calibre - read about the history of Calibre [here](https://calibre-ebook.com/about#history).

## What is this? ‚ùì

I have created this repo to have a place to house a bash script (or a series of bash scripts) that once run, will transform your barebones Proxmox Debian 12 LXC into a full-fledged Calibre-Web Automated installation.

I originally pitched this idea to the maintainers of the [Proxmox Community Helper Scripts](https://community-scripts.github.io/ProxmoxVE/) repo, but for various reasons it was deemed too risky, likely to break spectacularly, and too much effort to maintain. They are probably right (and please do check out their [amazing and extensive library of helper scripts](https://github.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE)), so I am going to try to do it myself.

More info to come.
